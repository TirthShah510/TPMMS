# Two Phase Multiway Merge Sort

Implemented a two-phase multiway merge sort with restriction of main memory such as 10 MB and 20 MB. Used two databases with 10,00,000 and 5,00,000 records and sort them based on Employee ID and remove duplicates. created smaller blocks of database and compare disk I/O's and the execution time for sort operations in each case of the two main memory sizes.
